# ðŸ‘º Devious
Devious is a large file linker that allows you to store large files outside of your git repository. This allows you to version control your large files without having to worry about the size of your repository.

## ðŸª„ Usage
The CLI is invoked with `dvs` which stands for data versioning system. You can find the downloads for the CLI on the releases page.

### Initialize Devious
To begin using Devious, you must first specify a storage directory for a given repository. This directory will contain all of your large files. To initialize a storage directory, run
```
dvs init <storage-path>
```

### File operations
You can get a list of possible commands using
```
dvs help
```
